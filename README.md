### Q1. Is JavaScript a dynamically typed language or a statically typed language?
JavaScript is a dynamically typed language. It means all type checks are done at runtime (when the program is executing). So, we can just assign anything to the variable and it works fine.

```javascript
let a;
a = 0;
console.log(a); // 0
a = "Hello";
console.log(a); // "Hello";
```
