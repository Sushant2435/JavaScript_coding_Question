**Q1. Is javascript a dynamically typed language or a statically typed language ?**
Javascript is a dynamically typed language.
It means all type checks are done at run time ( When program is executing )
So, we can just assign anything to the variable and it works fine.

  let a;
  a = 0;
  console.log(a) // 0
  a = "Hello"
  console.log(a) // "Hello"

String

null
undefined
Bigint
