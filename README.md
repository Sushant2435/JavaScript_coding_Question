### Q1. Is JavaScript a dynamically typed language or a statically typed language?
JavaScript is a dynamically typed language. It means all type checks are done at runtime (when the program is executing). So, we can just assign anything to the variable and it works fine.

```javascript
let a;
a = 0;
console.log(a); // 0
a = "Hello";
console.log(a); // "Hello";
```

### Q3. What is Hoisting in javascript ? (Most asked)
- In other scripting/server side languages, variables or functions must be declared before using it.
- In javascript, variables and functions can be used before declaring it. The javascript compiler moves all the declarations of variables and functions on top. so there will not be any error. This is called hoisting.
